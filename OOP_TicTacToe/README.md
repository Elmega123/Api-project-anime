I made a Tic-tac-toe game it may not seem like the most interesting project. But to me it’s pretty interesting because It was done with Object Oriented Programming in mind. I was trying to learn the concept and apply it to a project so that’s why it’s interesting to me

## Optimizations

1.	I could have made it look better with the use of more CSS.
2.  Also, I could keep score of how many times the user has won. I could do that by using local storage. 
3.	There are ways to make the AI more intelligent. Right now, the AI picks a random spot that hasn’t been selected yet. Several ways of improving that come to my mind. 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned to use Object Oriented Programming. I see now that it can be pretty useful specially in we want to avoid writing the same code over and over again. I also made a fighting game and OOP was very useful as the characters all had very similar properties only
